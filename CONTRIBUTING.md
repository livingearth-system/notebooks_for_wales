# How to Contribute to Notebooks for Wales

This repository is a collection of notebooks developed by users of the Welsh Data Cube for a variety of specific purposes. The notebooks here 
are deemed to be sufficiently well developed, using efficient and effective code, to deliver outputs in a format which can easily be 
incoporated into external reports, or even be the report in some cases. 

If you have a notebook which you believe will be of value to others, you are encouraged to share it, and this repository is the approved route to 
sharing. Here's how:

1. Create a new branch  
Take a clone of this repository in your own working area and create a new branch. New branch names should follow the format
`YYYYMMDD-<gitHub username>-<notebook-purpose>`, e.g. `20240603-bcalton-forested-area-report`

2. Add your notebook  
Create your notebook in an appropriate folder depending on the purpose and commit it to your new branch

3. Push your new branch
Pushing your new branch to GitHub will make it visible to everyone who has access to this repository. You can continue to make additional
changes, new commits and push new changes if you like.

5. Create a pull request
The base of your pull request should be `main` and the compare branch should be your newly created branch with the new notebook. Once created,
your pull request will be automatically sent for review. During this process, the reviewers may add comments or suggestions which require
additional changes and you will be alerted to these throughout the process.

6. Publication
Once the review process is complete, the new notebook will be merged into the main branch and automatically added to the shared
notebooks-for-wales directory on the Welsh Data Cube Jupyter Hub for everyone to access.
